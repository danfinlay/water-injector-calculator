# Water Injector Calculator

Based on notes from arborist Molly Batchelder.

Using the High-pressure water injector.

You want the water shooting out from the tip.  Holes on the side don’t provide the pressure that is required.  Here is our page on the water jet:

There is [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UA3tyD1s2Rk) of me using the tool to get you a better understanding of what the procedure looks like.
 
- The idea is that you want to apply around 2-3” of water on the soil surface. 
- Here is an example using a 10’x10’ area.  You can adjust it for 25’.  Once you figure out the amount of gallons to apply, you can calculate out how many minutes of run time if you hose applies 8 gallons a minute.
- Surface Area: Area is 10' x 10' or 100 square feet.
- Depth to which water is to be applied: 3 feet.
- Soil volume of the area: 100 sq feet multiplied by 3 feet deep is 300 cubic feet, wetted to field capacity.
- Estimated water holding capacity (field capacity) based upon soil texture type is: 1" to 1.5" per 12" depth.  We will use 1" for starters.  One inch of water over one square foot of surface area is equal to .62 gallons
- One inch of water per cubic foot of soil volume (300 cubic feet) is: .62 gallons x 300 = 186 gallons 
 
Hope this helps.  Let us know if you have any further questions.

## Video Notes

Treat an area extending 12x the tree's diameter around it, but not within a cirlce around the tree extending 3x the tree's diameter.
